=============

My dad wanted a simple program to manage notes on his computer, so I
wrote one. It's a simple program, but I hope someone in addition to my
dad finds it useful or interesting.

NoteBag.py is the main program to run. The first time you run NoteBag,
it will ask you to choose the folder where it will store all of the
notes you create.

The "Note Name" text box is used to add new notes, and to
automatically search through the notes you already have. If the "Note
Name" text box is empty, the bottom of the program window will list
all of your existing notes. As you enter text into the "Note Name"
text box, the bottom of the program window only show note names that
contain the text you have typed.

If you have typed the exact name of an existing note into the "Note
Name" text box, and you hit the "Enter" key or the "Open" button,
NoteBag will open the existing note in your document editor. If you
haven't typed the exact name of an existing note, and you hit "Enter"
or the "Add" button, NoteBag will create a new note in your notes
folder, and open it for you to edit. No two notes can have the same
name, and NoteBag does its best to make sure of that.

The button next to the "Note Name" text box will be labeled "Open" or
"Add" automatically, depending on what's appropriate.
